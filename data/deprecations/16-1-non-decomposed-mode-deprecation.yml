    From GitLab 18.0, we will require a [separate database for CI features](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7509).
    We recommend running both databases on the same Postgres instance(s) due to ease of management for most deployments.

    This change provides additional scalability for the largest of GitLab instances, like GitLab.com.
    This change applies to all installation methods: Omnibus GitLab, GitLab Helm chart, GitLab Operator, GitLab Docker images, and installation from source.
    Before upgrading to GitLab 18.0, please ensure you have [migrated](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/postgresql/multiple_databases.html) to two databases.
