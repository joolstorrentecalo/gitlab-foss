    Long term support (LTS) for [OpenSSL version 1.1.1 ended in September 2023](https://endoflife.date/openssl).

    Therefore, we have deprecated support for incoming OpenSSL version 1 (TLS 1.0 or 1.1) connections to GitLab and will remove support in GitLab 17.5.
    External integrations such as LDAP servers and webhooks must use OpenSSL version 3 (TLS 1.2).
