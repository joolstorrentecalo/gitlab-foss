# Jira issue integration

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, Self-managed, GitLab Dedicated

The Jira issue integration connects one or more GitLab projects to a Jira instance.
You can host the Jira instance yourself or in [Jira Cloud](https://www.atlassian.com/migration/assess/why-cloud).
The supported Jira versions are `6.x`, `7.x`, `8.x`, and `9.x`.

## Configure the integration

- **For Jira Cloud**:
  - You must have a [Jira Cloud API token](#create-a-jira-cloud-api-token) and the email address you used to create the token.
  - If you've enabled
    [IP allowlists](https://support.atlassian.com/security-and-access-policies/docs/specify-ip-addresses-for-product-access/), add the
    [GitLab.com IP range](../../user/gitlab_com/index.md#ip-range) to the allowlist to [view Jira issues](#view-jira-issues) in GitLab.
