# GitLab Duo

> - [First GitLab Duo features introduced](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/05/03/gitlab-ai-assisted-features/) in GitLab 16.0.
> - [Removed third-party AI setting](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/136144) in GitLab 16.6.
> - [Removed support for OpenAI from all GitLab Duo features](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10964) in GitLab 16.6.

GitLab is creating AI-assisted features across our DevSecOps platform. These features aim to help increase velocity and solve key pain points across the software development lifecycle. GitLab Duo features are accessible through the [IDE extension](../editor_extensions/index.md) and the GitLab UI. Some of the features are accessible through [GitLab Duo Chat](gitlab_duo_chat.md), which is available in both interfaces.

Some features are still in development. View details about [support for each status](../policy/experiment-beta-support.md#experiment) (Experiment, Beta, Generally Available).

GitLab is [transparent](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#transparency). As GitLab Duo features mature, the documentation will be updated to clearly state how and where you can access these capabilities.

## Controlling GitLab Duo features

There are two different levels at which GitLab Duo features can be controlled. The user level and the content level.

GitLab Duo features that are generally available are always enabled for all users that have access to these features. Whether they have access depends on the tier or the add-on as stated in the previous table. [Experimental](../policy/experiment-beta-support.md#experiment) and [Beta](../policy/experiment-beta-support.md#beta) GitLab Duo features need to be enabled as follows.

Owners of projects and groups as well as administrators of self-managed instances can control if GitLab Duo features can be used with their content such as code files.

### Giving access to users

If a feature is dependent on an add-on seat such as [Code Suggestions](project/repository/code_suggestions/index.md), access to the feature can be controlled through [GitLab Duo seat assignment](../subscriptions/subscription-add-ons.md#assign-gitlab-duo-pro-seats).

### Enabling Beta and Experimental AI-powered features

Features listed as Experiment and Beta are disabled by default. These features are subject to the [Testing Agreement](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/testing-agreement/).

#### GitLab.com

Prerequisites

- You must have the Owner role in the top-level group.

To enable Beta and Experimental AI-powered features, use the [Experiment and Beta features checkbox](group/manage.md#enable-experiment-and-beta-features).

#### GitLab self-managed

To enable Beta and Experimental AI-powered features for GitLab versions where GitLab Duo Chat is not yet generally available, see the [GitLab Duo Chat documentation](gitlab_duo_chat.md#for-self-managed).

### Enable outbound connections to enable GitLab Duo features on self-managed instances

- Your firewalls and HTTP/S proxy servers must allow outbound connections
  to `cloud.gitlab.com` and `customers.gitlab.com` on port `443` both with `https://` and `wws://`.
- Both `HTTP2` and the `'upgrade'` header must be allowed, because GitLab Duo
  uses both REST and WebSockets.
- To use an HTTP/S proxy, both `gitLab_workhorse` and `gitLab_rails` must have the necessary
  [web proxy environment variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/environment-variables.html) set.
- Check for restrictions on WebSocket (`wss://`) traffic to `wss://gitlab.com/-/cable` and other `.com` domains.
  Network policy restrictions on `wss://` traffic can cause issues with some GitLab Duo Chat
  services. Consider policy updates to allow these services.

### Disable GitLab Duo features for specific groups or projects or an entire instance

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, Self-managed, GitLab Dedicated

> - [Settings to disable AI features introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/12404) in GitLab 16.10.
> - [Settings to disable AI features added to the UI](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/441489) in GitLab 16.11.

You can disable GitLab Duo AI features for a group, project, or instance.
When it's disabled, any attempt to use GitLab Duo features on the group, project, or instance is blocked and an error is displayed.
GitLab Duo features are also blocked for resources in the group or project, like epics,
issues, and vulnerabilities.

#### For the group or project

Prerequisites:

- You must have the Owner role for the group or project.
- You must have a Premium or Ultimate subscription.

To disable GitLab Duo for a group:

<!-- vale gitlab.Substitutions = NO -->
1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.
1. Select **Settings > General**.
1. Expand **Permissions and group features**.
1. Clear the **Use Duo features** checkbox.
1. Optional. Select the **Enforce for all subgroups** checkbox to cascade the setting to
   all subgroups.

   ![Cascading setting](img/disable_duo_features_v17_0.png)
<!-- vale gitlab.Substitutions = YES -->

To disable GitLab Duo for a project:

1. Use the [GitLab GraphQL API](../api/graphql/getting_started.md)
   `projectSettingsUpdate` mutation.
1. Disable GitLab Duo for the project by setting the `duo_features_enabled` setting to `false`.
   (The default is `true`.)

#### For an instance

Prerequisites:

- You must be an administrator.

To disable GitLab Duo for an instance:

<!-- vale gitlab.Substitutions = NO -->
1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin Area**.
1. Select **Settings > General**
1. Expand **AI-powered features**.
1. Clear the **Use Duo features** checkbox.
1. Optional. Select the **Enforce for all subgroups** checkbox to cascade
   the setting to all groups in the instance.
<!-- vale gitlab.Substitutions = YES -->

#### Future plans

- An [issue exists](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/448709) for making the setting
  cascade to all groups and projects. Right now the projects and groups do not
  display the setting of the top-level group. To ensure the setting cascades,
  ensure `lock_duo_features_enabled` is set to `true`.
- An [issue exists](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/441532) to allow administrators
  to override the setting for specific groups or projects.

## Experimental AI features and how to use them

The following subsections describe the experimental AI features in more detail.

### Explain code in the Web UI with Code explanation

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Freely available for Premium and Ultimate for a limited time. In the future, will require Premium or Ultimate with [GitLab Duo Pro](../subscriptions/subscription-add-ons.md).
**Offering:** GitLab.com
**Status:** Experiment

> - Introduced in GitLab 15.11 as an [Experiment](../policy/experiment-beta-support.md#experiment) on GitLab.com.

To use this feature:

- The parent group of the project must:
  - Enable the [experiment and beta features setting](group/manage.md#enable-experiment-and-beta-features).
- You must:
  - Belong to at least one group with the [experiment and beta features setting](group/manage.md#enable-experiment-and-beta-features) enabled.
  - Have sufficient permissions to view the project.

GitLab can help you get up to speed faster if you:

- Spend a lot of time trying to understand pieces of code that others have created, or
- Struggle to understand code written in a language that you are not familiar with.

By using a large language model, GitLab can explain the code in natural language.

To explain your code:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select any file in your project that contains code.
1. On the file, select the lines that you want to have explained.
1. On the left side, select the question mark (**{question}**). You might have to scroll to the first line of your selection to view it. This sends the selected code, together with a prompt, to provide an explanation to the large language model.
1. A drawer is displayed on the right side of the page. Wait a moment for the explanation to be generated.
1. Provide feedback about how satisfied you are with the explanation, so we can improve the results.

You can also have code explained in the context of a merge request. To explain
code in a merge request:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Code > Merge requests**, then select your merge request.
1. On the secondary menu, select **Changes**.
1. On the file you would like explained, select the three dots (**{ellipsis_v}**) and select **View File @ $SHA**.

   A separate browser tab opens and shows the full file with the latest changes.

1. On the new tab, select the lines that you want to have explained.
1. On the left side, select the question mark (**{question}**). You might have to scroll to the first line of your selection to view it. This sends the selected code, together with a prompt, to provide an explanation to the large language model.
1. A drawer is displayed on the right side of the page. Wait a moment for the explanation to be generated.
1. Provide feedback about how satisfied you are with the explanation, so we can improve the results.

![How to use the Explain Code Experiment](img/explain_code_experiment.png)

We cannot guarantee that the large language model produces results that are correct. Use the explanation with caution.

## Data usage

GitLab AI features leverage generative AI to help increase velocity and aim to help make you more productive. Each feature operates independently of other features and is not required for other features to function. GitLab selects the best-in-class large-language models for specific tasks. We use [Google Vertex AI Models](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/overview#genai-models) and [Anthropic Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/product).

### Progressive enhancement

These features are designed as a progressive enhancement to existing GitLab features across our DevSecOps platform. They are designed to fail gracefully and should not prevent the core functionality of the underlying feature. You should note each feature is subject to its expected functionality as defined by the relevant [feature support policy](../policy/experiment-beta-support.md).

### Stability and performance

These features are in a variety of [feature support levels](../policy/experiment-beta-support.md#beta). Due to the nature of these features, there may be high demand for usage which may cause degraded performance or unexpected downtime of the feature. We have built these features to gracefully degrade and have controls in place to allow us to mitigate abuse or misuse. GitLab may disable **beta and experimental** features for any or all customers at any time at our discretion.

### Data privacy

GitLab Duo AI features are powered by a generative AI models. The processing of any personal data is in accordance with our [Privacy Statement](https://about.gitlab.com/privacy/). You may also visit the [Sub-Processors page](https://about.gitlab.com/privacy/subprocessors/#third-party-sub-processors) to see the list of our Sub-Processors that we use to provide these features.

### Data retention

The below reflects the current retention periods of GitLab AI model [Sub-Processors](https://about.gitlab.com/privacy/subprocessors/#third-party-sub-processors):

- Anthropic discards model input and output data immediately after the output is provided. Anthropic currently does not store data for abuse monitoring. Model input and output is not used to train models.
- Google discards model input and output data immediately after the output is provided. Google currently does not store data for abuse monitoring. Model input and output is not used to train models.

All of these AI providers are under data protection agreements with GitLab that prohibit the use of Customer Content for their own purposes, except to perform their independent legal obligations.

GitLab retains input and output for up to 30 days for the purpose of troubleshooting, debugging, and addressing latency issues.

### Telemetry

GitLab Duo collects aggregated or de-identified first-party usage data through our [Snowplow collector](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/platform/snowplow/). This usage data includes the following metrics:

- Number of unique users
- Number of unique instances
- Prompt lengths
- Model used
- Status code responses
- API responses times

### Training data

GitLab does not train generative AI models based on private (non-public) data. The vendors we work with also do not train models based on private data.

For more information on our AI [sub-processors](https://about.gitlab.com/privacy/subprocessors/#third-party-sub-processors), see:

- Google Vertex AI Models APIs [data governance](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/data-governance) and [responsible AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/responsible-ai).
- Anthropic Claude's [constitution](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claudes-constitution).

### Model accuracy and quality

Generative AI may produce unexpected results that may be:

- Low-quality
- Incoherent
- Incomplete
- Produce failed pipelines
- Insecure code
- Offensive or insensitive
- Out of date information

GitLab is actively iterating on all our AI-assisted capabilities to improve the quality of the generated content. We improve the quality through prompt engineering, evaluating new AI/ML models to power these features, and through novel heuristics built into these features directly.
